## Hello hello!
##I'm Rachel, and I'm currently very new to Github. I've learned how to upload to Github specifically for classes, but that's about the extent of my knowledge.
##I'm hoping to get better at using this website with time. This account is mostly just for class.
##Here's to hoping! Wish me luck! ðŸŒŸâœ¨ðŸŒŸâœ¨
